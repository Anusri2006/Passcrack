# 🔐 PassCark - Password Strength & Cracking Time Estimator

## 🚀 Overview
PassCark is a powerful tool designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords and estimate the time required to crack them. It leverages entropy calculations, common password patterns, and brute-force attack estimations to provide accurate security insights.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Real-time Password Strength Analysis** – Evaluates length, complexity, and common patterns.  
✅ **Cracking Time Estimation** – Predicts how long an attacker would take to brute-force the password.  
✅ **Security Recommendations** – Provides suggestions to enhance password security.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Instant feedback for better security awareness.  

## 🛠 Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run PassCark:

### 📌 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: Install using the command below

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📥 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/passcark.git
cd passcark
```

### 🚀 Run the Application
```bash
python passcark.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Password Input** – Users enter a password in the application.
2. **Strength Analysis** – The system evaluates length, complexity, and common vulnerabilities.
3. **Cracking Time Estimation** – Based on computing power estimates (e.g., 1 billion guesses per second), it calculates how long an attacker would take to crack the password.
4. **Security Suggestions** – If the password is weak, the tool suggests improvements like adding special characters or increasing length.

## 📊 Example Output
```
Password: mypassword123
Strength: Weak
Estimated Time to Crack: Less than a second
Suggestion: Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🖥 Implementing a GUI version.
- 🛡 Adding advanced password pattern detection.
- 🔗 Integrating real-time security breach checks using APIs.
